    <h2>The crispiest potato wedges</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a culmination of my experiments to try and create the crispiest possible
        wedges without too much hassle like deep frying and freezing.</p>
    <p>I went through several iterations mainly in the pre-oven phase that included microwaving
        and also soaking in cold water.</p>
