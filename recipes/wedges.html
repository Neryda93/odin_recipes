    <h2>The crispiest potato wedges</h2>
    <p>This recipe is a culmination of my experiments to try and create the crispiest possible
        wedges without too much hassle like deep frying and freezing.</p>
    <p>I went through several iterations mainly in the pre-oven phase that included microwaving
        and also soaking in cold water.</p>
    
        <h3>Ingredients</h3>
        <ul>
         <li>Potatoes</li>
         <li>Spices</li>
         <li>Oil</li>
         <li>Baking soda</li>
         <li>Baking powder/Cornstartch mix</li>
        </ul>    

        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Cut potatoes into wedges.</li>
            <li>Bring water to boil. Add salt and baking soda.</li>
            <li>Parboil potatoes for 10 minutes. Drain the water and give the potatoes
                a good shake to fluff them up.
            </li>
            <li>Add oil, spices and the baking power/cornstarch mix to the potatoes.</li>
